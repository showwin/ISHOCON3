1. Use Redis for seat reservation

Key is scheduleID, and value is the list of available seat IDs.
When reserving a seat, use LPOP to get and remove a seat ID from the list.
And remove seat reservation logic from the DB transaction.


2. Return variety of schedules from /api/schedules

When returning schedules from /api/schedules, return variety of schedules.
4 from the earliest after 2 hours from now
2 from the earliest after 6 hours from now
2 from the earliest after 12 hours from now
1 from between 19:00 and 22:00
1 from between 22:00 and 24:00

So buyer can buy whole tickets to complete their itinerary.

3. Waiting room optimization

Increase available users from 5 to 150.
Reduce interval from 5 seconds to 1 second.

4. Recommendation algorithm improvement

When recommending alternative schedules, recommend the next schedule recursively.

5. Add indices to DB tables


6. Implement rate limiter on Nginx for `/api/login`

For Admin to login smoothly, and reduce load on app.
Block unnecessary login attempts.
